                \item Imperfect clock forwards ``nominal time'' after all honest clocks have ``ping'' it \cite{uc-synchronous-clock}.
                \item Adversary can set additional drifts to honest clocks \cite{ouroboros-chronos}.

    \begin{center}
        Honest parties cannot learn the exact time, but can proceed at ``roughly'' the same speed.

        We define \emph{honest majority} with respect to the random oracle queries in terms of the nominal time.
